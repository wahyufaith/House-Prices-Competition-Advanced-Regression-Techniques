# House-Prices Competition-Advanced-Regression-Techniques

### In this repository I try to make predictions about house prices by applying machine learning methods, I got the dataset from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> site.
### about the illustration of the task in the real world and an explanation of the dataset you can read as follows:

## Description

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
